	abstract = {Flow field prediction is crucial for evaluating the performance of airfoils and aerodynamic optimization. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods usually require a considerable amount of computational resources and time. In this study, a composite model based on deep learning is proposed for flow field prediction. The variational autoencoder (VAE) model is designed to extract representative features of flow fields. The VAE model is trained to determine the optimal latent variable dimension and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence weight. Several physical constraints based on mass conservation and pressure coefficient are introduced to reduce the reconstruction loss and improve the model generalization ability. A DeepONet-MLP model, which combines a deep operator network (DeepONet) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is trained to achieve the nonlinear mapping from airfoil shapes and lift coefficients to latent variables in the VAE with fewer parameters. Eventually, a DeepONet-MLP-VAE model, which connects the decoder in VAE with DeepONet-MLP, is applied for fast flow field prediction. The results show that the proposed model can accurately and efficiently predict the transonic flow field, with a mean absolute error of 0.0016 and an average processing time of 0.010 s per flow field, which significantly accelerates the CFD evaluation process.},

	abstract = {A transonic buffet is a detrimental phenomenon that occurs on supercritical airfoils and limits the aircraft operating envelope. Traditional methods for predicting buffet onset rely on multiple computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess a series of airfoil flowfields and then apply criteria to them, which is slow and hinders optimization efforts. This study introduces an innovative approach for rapid buffet-onset prediction. A machine-learning flowfield prediction model was pretrained on a large database and then deployed offline to replace the simulations in the buffet prediction process for new airfoil designs. Unlike using a model to directly predict buffet onset, the proposed technique offers better visualization capabilities by providing users with intuitive flowfield outputs. It also demonstrates superior generalization ability, as evidenced by a 32.5\% reduction in the average buffet-onset prediction error on the testing dataset. This method was used to optimize the buffet performance of 11 distinct airfoils within and outside the training dataset. The optimization results were verified with simulations and proved to yield improved samples across all cases. It was affirmed that the pretrained flowfield prediction model can be applied to accelerate aerodynamic shape optimization, but further work is still needed to raise its reliability for this safety-critical task.},

	abstract = {With their development, machine learning models can be used instead of computational fluid dynamics simulations to predict flow fields in aerodynamic optimization. However, it is difficult to construct a prediction model for swept wings with various planform geometries because too many samples are required to cover the parameter space. In the present paper, a new model framework is proposed to predict wing surface pressure and friction distributions with fewer samples. The distributed geometry parameters along spanwise are used as model inputs instead of the global planform parameters, and processors are designed to help the model better learn the local effect of geometric variation. The model is trained and tested on simple swept wings with single segment and linear twist distribution, where it outperforms the global input model by 57.6\% in terms of lift coefficient prediction errors on small dataset sizes. The distributed input also enables the model to be transferred from single wings to more engineering-practical yet complex kink wings. After fine-tuning with a few samples, model accuracy for kink wings can be similar to that of simple wings, which proves the model for wings with complex planform geometries can be efficiently built with the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The single expansion ramp nozzle often experiences poor thrust performance at overexpansion conditions. Fluidic injection presents a promising solution to mitigate this issue, although there lacks an effective method to determine injection parameters under varying nozzle operating conditions. This paper presents a novel residual autoencoder surrogate model to fast calculate the pressure and temperature profiles on nozzle surfaces. Considering the characteristics of the nozzle flowfield, the model is designed to predict the difference between the profiles with and without the injection. This approach boosts the model's predictive accuracy by 20\% and enhances its transferability. Furthermore, the gradient-based optimization algorithm is applied to the model to discern optimal injection parameters under eleven distinct nozzle operating conditions whose nozzle pressure ratios range from 12 to 40. The results indicate a successful increase in average thrust coefficients by 0.76\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Machine-learning-based models provide a promising way to rapidly acquire transonic swept wing flow fields but suffer from large computational costs in establishing training datasets. Here, a physics-embedded transfer-learning framework is proposed to efficiently train the model by leveraging the idea that a three-dimensional flow field around wings can be analyzed with two-dimensional flow fields around cross-sectional airfoils. An airfoil aerodynamics prediction model is pretrained with airfoil samples. Then, an airfoil-to-wing transfer model is fine-tuned with a few wing samples to predict three-dimensional flow fields based on two-dimensional results on each spanwise cross section. Sweep theory is embedded when determining the corresponding airfoil geometry and operating conditions, and to obtain the sectional airfoil lift coefficient, which is one of the operating conditions, the low-fidelity vortex lattice method and data-driven methods are proposed and evaluated. Compared to a nontransfer model, introducing the pretrained model reduces the error by 30\%, whereas introducing sweep theory further reduces the error by 9\%. When reducing the dataset size, less than half of the wing training samples are need to reach the same error level as the nontransfer framework, which makes establishing the model much easier.},
