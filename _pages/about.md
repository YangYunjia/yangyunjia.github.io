Hi, I'm Yunjia. I am working at University of Munich with [Prof. Nils Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/about/n-thuerey/), with interest on applying machine
learning to design optimization tasks, especially the aerodynamic shape optimization.

Currently, my research is sponsored with the BMW, and trying to build pipelines for coupling differential flow solver with gradient-based shape optimization for autos. 

Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Haixin Chen at Tsinghua University, China. My doctoral research focused on 
surrogate-based aerodynamic shape optimization for airfoils and wings, where I proposed a prior-based strategy to enhance model's generalization ability, and established
a uncertainty-aware methodology for the optimization.

Besides research, I'm a fan of trains and airplanes, and take photographs for them around the world. You can find more in the Blog channel.
